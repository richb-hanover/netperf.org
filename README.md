# About this site 

This site has substantially all the content from the original netperf.org site, revised to use Strapdown.js markup

Strapdown is a Javascript library (http://strapdownjs.com/) that takes Markdown text that's contained between `<xmp>` tags and converts it to attractive HTML. It is good for making small static sites look great.

The files in this repository preserve:

* All the top-level HTML files of the netperf.org site
* All the images from the images subdirectory
* The netperf/netserver man pages, and other documents from the training subdirectory
* *None* of the files in the data subdirectory
