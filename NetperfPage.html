# Welcome to the Netperf Homepage

## What is netperf?

Netperf is a benchmark program that can be used to measure the performance of
many different types of networking. It provides tests for both
unidirectional throughput, and end-to-end latency. The environments
currently measureable by netperf include:

* TCP and UDP via BSD Sockets for both IPv4 and IPv6
* DLPI
* Unix Domain Sockets
* SCTP for both IPv4 and IPv6 

*Note:* Hewlett-Packard provides the resources of this server to 
help the network benchmarking community. 
It also helps keep one of their engineers happy. <IMG SRC="./images/smiley.gif" ALT=":-)"/>
