# Netperf Performance Numbers

Sadly, when netperf.org migrated from one platform to another, the "db"
application it was using was no longer available.  As such, it is no 
longer possible to submit/retrieve performance numbers for netperf as 
it was in the past.

For the intensely curious, the last contents of the netperf results database
can be found at <A HREF="./data">the data subdirectory</A> which
contains a flat ASCII file and a .h file describing its layout.

If you encounter any problems, please feel free to provide <A HREF="mailto:netperf-feedback@netperf.org">feedback</A>.
